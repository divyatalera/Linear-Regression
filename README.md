# Linear-Regression

Itâ€™s easy to predict (or calculate) the Price based on Value and vice versa using the equation of **y = a + bx**

A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. 
The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y.

a is the constant term or the y intercept. It is the value of the dependent variable when x = 0.

b is the coefficient of the independent variable. It is also known as the slope and gives the rate of change of the dependent variable.


In conclusion, with Simple Linear Regression, we have to do 5 steps as per below:
1. Importing the dataset.
2. Splitting dataset into training set and testing set (2 dimensions of X and y per each set). Normally, the testing set should be 5% to 30% of dataset.
3. Visualize the training set and testing set to double check (you can bypass this step if you want).
4. Initializing the regression model and fitting it using training set (both X and y).
5. Prediction
